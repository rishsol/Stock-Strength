# Stock-Strength
I dabble with web scraping and financial APIs to obtain financial data of publicly traded companies (mainly Apple to begin with) and use metrics such as the relative strength index and comparisons of market value and book value of stocks to determine whether investing in the company stock at the moment is worth it.

In conducting my analysis of the book value per share (BVPS) and market price of a company (using the graph I created, StockStrengthGraph.png), it becomes evident that certain sectors have a higher difference between these two metrics than others. Namely, technology companies (such as Google and Apple) have higher BVPS's relative to their market price than real estate and food and beverage companies (such as Realogy Holdings and Pepsi). This does not mean that the selected technology companeis are overvalued and real estate and food and beverage companies are undervalued. Rather the stark difference between across these sectors suggests higher consumer optimism and customer loyalty in the technology field than in the real estate and food and beverage industries. 


The results suggest that pure numerical analysis cannot be enough in determining whether a company is worth investing in. Human sentiment plays a major role in the values of corporations on the stock market.
