# Stock-Strength
I dabble with web scraping and financial APIs to obtain financial data of publicly traded companies (mainly Apple to begin with) and use metrics such as the relative strength index and comparisons of market value and book value of stocks to determine whether investing in the company stock at the moment is worth it.

In conducting my analysis of the book value per share (BVPS) and market price of a company (see image below) it becomes evident that certain sectors have a higher difference between these two metrics than others. Three industries were used in my analysis, with three companies representing each. The industries and companies are outlined below:

Technology/Software:Apple, Google, Microsoft

Real Estate: Realogy Holdings, Prologis, Macerich

Food/Beverage:Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Dr. Pepper

Based on the graph, technology companies (the first three companies on the graph) have higher BVPS's relative to their market price than real estate and food and beverage companies (the middle three companies are real estate companies while the final three are food/beverage companies). This does not mean that the selected technology companeis are overvalued and real estate and food and beverage companies are undervalued. Rather the stark difference between across these sectors suggests higher consumer optimism and customer loyalty in the technology field than in the real estate and food and beverage industries. 


The results suggest that pure numerical analysis cannot be enough in determining whether a company is worth investing in. Human sentiment plays a major role in the values of corporations on the stock market.
